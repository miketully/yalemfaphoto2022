        Possessed, I began the day with a simple question:<br>
        how will I catch the light? There was still so much<br> 
        left to do in the day, a day that started<br> 
        days ago. Fields of wet grass<br> 
        I hadn’t been on. Could I go there next? I made plans<br> 
        for the city out in front of me. The knowledge<br> 
        my hamstring held could take me there.<br>
        </p>
    
      <p>
        The birds had said their piece<br> 
        the night before. The fruit bowl had arrived. Not a piece<br> 
        of fruit wilted or marred except for a single thumbprint<br>
        printed onto the skin of a pear. Good thing<br>
        I never cared for pears.<br> 
        I gave the birds eternal glory—watermelon rinds—<br>
        and they gave me restlessness in return.<br> 
        Four hornets now, more to come.<br>
        </p>
        
      <p>
        Then you walked in. Sudden company. First<br> 
        the string of small admissions—that you had only your hairstylist<br>
        to thank for the promotion; the pepper ants<br>
        you crushed with your heel, the ash you tossed<br>
        into the mailbox—neither of them accidents.<br>
        Then the larger ones,<br>
        the ones I could not handle. I made it clear<br> 
        I didn’t need the photographic evidence. I sit<br>
        with my reality all day long.<br>
        </p>
